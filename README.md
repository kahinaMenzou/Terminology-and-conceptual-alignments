# Terminology-and-conceptual-alignments
Binding of data from the field of culture (meta data on classical music, ethnic names, cultural events), from the catalogs of 3 major French cultural institutions (The National Library of France, Radio France and the Philharmonie de Paris).

The institution's experts, organized their data into two specific databases, called EUTERPE, which gathers the data of the planned concerts, and another named ALOES or PP, which  includes the concerts achieved.

The objective is to achieve alignment and matching of the various concerts (planned and realized) of the institution from these two databases.
